      <h3>About John</h3>
      <h6>Wednesday, July 25, 2018</h6>
      <p>John has held positions in Tech Support, Operations, Development and Leadership. Most recently he has been a Director
        of Software Engineering for SPS Commerce. He spent the early part of his career working for LEGO Systems as a professional
        LEGO model builder.</p>
      <p>John lives in Minneapolis with his wife, two daughters, and enough LEGO bricks to swim in.</p>
      <h4>More About John</h4>
      <p>John began working in technology after being exposed to a computer in fifth grade. He rapidly discovered he had a penchant
        for it, taking and then teaching an programming class as a middle schooler. Shortly after high school, he developed
        a warehouse box storage system while working for Cargill Companies.</p>
      <p>While in his senior year at the University of Minnesota, John was offered a job as a LEGO model builder. He spent 18
        months in that position building a variety of large scale LEGO models that were shipped all over the world for display.
        He left after discovering that being a LEGO model builder was an amazing job, but there wasn't much of a future in
        it for him</p>
      <p>
        <a class="text-muted" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI89s14VtZk&index=6&list=FLfes2Pj_Z9t4ddEBV_z9aKg&t=0s">Wait? Did you say Professional LEGO model builder?</a>
      </p>
      <p>Back in Minneapolis, John got a job working second shift at Zeos International on their technical support group. While
        buying a single piece of memory to repair a friend's computer, he was offered another job at a small PC manufacturing
        firm. It was in this position that John discovered that he was excited about work where there would always be a strong
        opinion about performance. You might be a brilliant success or a miserable failure, but everyone would at least have
        an opinion. It is these sorts of opportunities that have attracted John since.</p>
      <p>Continuing to teach himself anything he could, John learned networking and development technologies and put those to
        work at Graphics Technologies, a small hardware distributor. He built a new sales system to allow quotes and orders
        to be placed more accurately and processed more swiftly than the manual process that had existed before. He built
        his first corporate website and first corporate email server in 1997.</p>
      <p>In 2000, John moved to ThermoKing, a division of Ingersoll Rand. He made a quick impression by inisting on new software
        engineering practices, building the first corporate Intranet, and securing and stablizing the dealer web portal.
        After six months, John was asked to take over a project to develop a corporate intranet for all of Ingersoll Rand.
        From there, he lead technology teams that handled web applications, email applications and dealer technologies. His
        work cummilated with the creation of a new global CMS system to allow all of Ingersoll Rand's business units to publish
        website properties properly connected to Ingersoll Rand's brand anywhere in the world. He was given an Ingersoll
        Rand president's award as a result of his efforts.</p>
      <p>In 2008, John took an opportunity with Kroll Ontrack to develop a brand new knowledge management product for the Investigative
        arm of Kroll Ontrack. In this role, he built that product, as well as a identity protection product for Kroll Fraud
        Solutions and two legal service applications for the parent company. John led the change in the Legal Services group
        to move the product from a client based system on a local data center to a web deployed application that could leverage
        the emerging cloud technologies.</p>

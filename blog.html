      <h3>Hiring the Right Software </h3>
      <h6>Monday, March 28, 2011</h6>
      <p>Found this today in a book on interface design. I don't think that I could have possibly given a better metaphor for
        how we should think about our users when we're doing interface design.</p>
      <p>I, like many people (whether they realize it or not), tend to “hire” software the same way I would hire a person. I
        look for certain qualities, like a helpful nature, reliability, trustworthiness, and other things I’d expect to find
        in a good Boy Scout. Mostly, I look for software that can get work done in a smart and timely fashion so I can feel
        productive as a result of having hired the software – just what I’d want in a prospective employee. I look for characteristics
        that make me say “Hey, you’re swell. I’d like to work with you, take you under my wing, and invite you over for brunch.
        Come, join me in a game of Parcheesi.”</p>
      <p>Software, however, often interrupts me while I’m working, tells me I’ve made a mistake, refuses to help out in a useful
        way when I get stuck, spends a lot time revealing things about how it works instead of simply telling me the job
        is done, and exhibits many other behaviors I find undesirable in employees. But usual I’m stuck with it. I can’t
        find a way to live without the product because it’s so valuable to my work, for whatever reason. I can’t simply trade
        it in for something that may or may not be better, so I suffer through it. I yell at it, procrastinate dealing with
        it, and complain about it, but I live with it. This, of course, bugs me to no end.</p>
      <p>Designing the Obvious, Robert Hoekman Jr.</p>
      <p>Really like the metaphor here. Every time I help people look for ways to implement technology as a tool to help make
        their lives more efficient, I find that a similar conversation has been playing out in my head. If more people start
        thinking about the end user of the software "hiring" it to do a job and working on making the software shine as that
        "employee" we'd all have a lot fewer frustrated users.</p>


      <h3>Confusing the tool implementation with the solution.</h3>
      <h6>Monday, August 31, 2009</h6>
      <p>I don't know how many times I've come across the situation where people describe their technology problem by stating
        the solution they've arrived at. "I'll be all set, once I learn to use product X."</p>
      <p>It's frustrating because I think by and large, people in my line of work do a perfectly miserable job understanding
        how to help people get their work done with technology. We get settled in so quickly on what the solution is that
        is pitched to us, that we never get at what the problem is.</p>

      <p>I find this to be never so true as when we talk about social media. People have completely confused the tools with
        the concept. I blogged a while back about how we'll look on twitter as a fad like CB radio in a couple of years.
        It's not because it's a bad idea, or because social media doesn't have staying power. Social media has a lot of staying
        power. It's helping to even out what had been a gender gap on the Internet. It's become easier and simpler than ever
        to keep a wide network of people up to date with what is happening in your life. But connecting the dots and proclaiming
        that twitter will change the world is a rather large leap. What will change is the way people communicate and see
        your brand. It will be dictated by social media. Much the same way it always had before we had mass media. Having
        an experience that was wildly popular or unpopular with your brand and communicating it with your family and friends
        has always had a stronger impact than advertising. What's changed hasn't been the underlying human behavior, it's
        been the ease of which that experience can be communicated, searched, and retold.</p>

      <p>The problem we're trying to solve is how can I communicate to the world at large, specifically the people who are interested
        in what I'm saying, more effectively?</p>

      <p>Is that answer twitter? Well, for now, maybe. But there are problems with the underlying architecture. Maybe I want
        to tweet my location, but only to my family. Or maybe I want to share a picture of the office building, but only
        to a group of co-workers. These are obvious extensions of the functionality. Things that people discover they want
        after they've been in the tool for a while. Things you don't know that you're going to need when "You have to get
        on Twitter!" </p>

      <p>I use the metaphor of a sixteen year old wanting a new car. Yes, they can drive the car, and yes they are absolutely
        certain of what they need in the car. They will vigorously defend the things that they think they need. But by the
        time they are twenty five, they will have discovered that the things they thought they needed at sixteen were absolutely
        unimportant.</p>

      <p>Social media is another wave in being able to communicate more effectively with the people around us. The technology
        around it will continue to innovate. It will discover methods to implement status tagging so that you can define
        your followers into groups of who can see what. It will allow you to define feeds of information that you are interested
        in being told about, but aren't interested in talking back to.</p>

      <p>The problem for Twitter is that Facebook has the groundwork in terms of technology to execute on those sorts of improvements.
        All that Facebook needs to eat Twitter's lunch is option to expose status feeds to the general public. And if you
        followed the mistaken release of a new beta flavor of Facebook, you'll see that's something they are getting ready
        to roll out.</p>

      <p>Want to be ahead of your customer's expectations? Start to listen to what the pain points are for them. What are the
        things you'd wish you could do. If my time in the brand management group taught me anything, it was a new-found respect
        for the work in discovering the unmet and under met needs of the customer. That's all about asking the right questions,
        not about shoving a solution at them.</p>
